Universal Life offers more flexibility and market-linked growth potential but carries higher investment risk and active management requirements."

                desc: "An Immediate Financing Arrangement (IFA) is a leverage strategy enabling business owners to purchase permanent life insurance while preserving capital. By assigning the policy’s Cash Surrender Value (CSV) as collateral, the corporation secures a line of credit—often up to 100% of the CSV—to reinvest in income-generating business or investment activities. This structure allows for the potential tax deductibility of interest, reducing the net cost of insurance while maintaining liquidity and establishing a tax-free Capital Dividend Account (CDA) credit."
